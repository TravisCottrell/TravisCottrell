                    I am a former CNC machinist with Bachelors degree in
                    Computer Science from Kent State University and graduated in
                    2021 . I love eveything technology related. I've had a
                    passion for building and tinkering with computers for about
                    6 years. I also love CNC machines like lathes, mills, and 3d
                    printers and being able to create things. Some of my hobbies
                    include reading, hiking, and video games.
